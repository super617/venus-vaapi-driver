# Architecture

## Boundary

This project is a userspace libva driver. It does not speak Qualcomm HFI
directly and does not duplicate the kernel Venus driver.

## Capability policy

The V4L2 probe intersects the formats exposed by qcom-venus with a project
allowlist. The allowlist contains only formats already validated on Xiaomi
Raphael:

| Codec | Decode candidate | Encode candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 | yes | yes |
| HEVC Main 8-bit | yes | yes |
| VP8 | yes | yes |
| VP9 Profile 0 | yes | no |

A candidate is not a VA-API capability. The driver reports no VA profiles
until the complete VA submission path for that profile has tests and device
evidence.

MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.263, VC-1, Xvid, HEVC Main10 and VP9 encode are outside the
initial allowlist.

## Decode model

Venus implements the V4L2 stateful decoder interface. It consumes complete
coded-stream chunks on OUTPUT and returns decoded frames on CAPTURE. VA-API
VLD clients submit picture parameters, slice parameters and slice data. Each
codec adapter must therefore collect all buffers between `vaBeginPicture`
and `vaEndPicture`, construct the stream syntax required by the stateful
decoder, and associate the dequeued CAPTURE buffer with the requested VA
surface.

Dynamic resolution changes must follow the V4L2 source-change sequence. A
CAPTURE buffer cannot be requeued while a client owns the corresponding VA
surface.

## Encode model

The encoder queues raw VA surfaces on V4L2 OUTPUT and returns complete coded
chunks through V4L2 CAPTURE. VA sequence, picture, slice and miscellaneous
parameters are translated to V4L2 controls before streaming.

`venus-v4l2-encode` isolates that stateful session before VA integration. The
first test fixes the input to progressive 640x480 NV12, Baseline profile,
1 Mbit/s, 15 fps, a 15-frame GOP and no B frames. It requests four raw OUTPUT
buffers and sixteen encoded CAPTURE buffers, then drains with
`V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP` and requires the emitted H.264 stream to decode to all 30
frames in software.

## Surface plan

1. CPU-visible linear NV12 surfaces for the first correctness milestone.
2. DMA-BUF allocation and V4L2 import.
3. DRM PRIME export through `vaExportSurfaceHandle`.
4. Explicit synchronization and direct display integration.

The first milestone intentionally prioritizes byte-correct H.264 decode over
zero-copy presentation.

## Stateful session validation

`venus-v4l2-decode` keeps the V4L2 session independent from VA object code. It
starts only the H.264 OUTPUT queue, submits stream metadata, waits for the
initial source-change event, then selects linear NV12 and creates the CAPTURE
queue from the parsed format. It maps the actual buffer counts returned by
`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`, queues every capture buffer, submits one Annex-B access unit
per OUTPUT buffer, drains with `V4L2_DEC_CMD_STOP`, and writes dequeued frames
in display order. The device
test uses a progressive stream without B frames so queue correctness can be
established before timestamp-to-surface reordering is introduced.

`--codec=hevc` runs the same session against HEVC, where the access-unit
delimiter is an AUD with nal_unit_type 35 and the splitter therefore has to be
told which codec it is reading. `--codec=vp9` takes an IVF container instead:
VP9 carries no start codes, and the IVF frame table is what gives the per-picture
boundaries the firmware needs - two pictures in one OUTPUT buffer stall the
decoder just as a whole Annex-B stream does. Both formats are otherwise the same
queueing and drain sequence as H.264.

## H.264 bytestream reconstruction

FFmpeg submits the original slice NAL bytes through `VASliceDataBufferType`,
but VA-API does not forward the original SPS and PPS NAL units to a VLD
backend. The H.264 adapter therefore reconstructs a conservative SPS/PPS from
`VAPictureParameterBufferH264` and the first
`VASliceParameterBufferH264`, applies emulation prevention, and prefixes every
NAL with an Annex-B start code.

The initial writer accepts progressive 8-bit 4:2:0 streams using picture order
count types 0 or 2. Interlaced streams, 10-bit streams, FMO, picture order
count type 1 and custom scaling matrices remain disabled until dedicated
coverage exists.
