# venus-vaapi-driver

A userspace VA-API backend for the Qualcomm Venus stateful V4L2 M2M codec,
initially targeting Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro / Mi 9T Pro (Raphael, SM8150).

## Current status

**H.264 High VLD and EncSlice are validated for progressive 8-bit video
through Raphael's native 1080x2340 and 2340x1080 orientations. HEVC Main
decode and encode, and VP9 Profile 0 decode, are validated on QCM6490/QCS6490
boards (iris_vpu, `msm_vidc_driver`). VP8 remains disabled.**

The repository currently provides:

- `venus_drv_video.so` with a libva 1.20-compatible driver entry point;
- a complete mandatory libva vtable with explicit unsupported results;
- direct qcom-venus discovery through `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` and
  `VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`;
- a validated codec allowlist independent from generic kernel format tables;
- `venus-vaapi-info` for inspecting the live V4L2 devices;
- host tests for the allowlist, no-device behavior, driver initialization and
  exported ABI symbol;
- a bounded H.264 Annex-B assembler that reconstructs conservative SPS/PPS
  NAL units and validates every VA slice range before copying it;
- HEVC parameter sets rebuilt the same way in `src/hevc_headers.c`: VA-API
  hands over parsed fields, not VPS/SPS/PPS NAL units, so they are written
  back out of `VAPictureParameterBufferHEVC` and emitted once per sequence;
- an isolated V4L2 stateful decoder session and `venus-v4l2-decode` tool for
  validating queue order, MMAP buffers, source-change events and drain, with
  `--codec=hevc` and `--codec=vp9` covering the other two coded formats the
  kernel exposes on the same node;
- experimental H.264 Baseline/Main/High VLD config, context, buffer, surface,
  sync and NV12 image-download paths backed by that same session;
- a device-validated H.264 stateful encoder session for NV12 input,
  V4L2 controls, encoded CAPTURE packets and drain;
- experimental H.264 Baseline/Main/High EncSlice config, context, parameter,
  coded-buffer, sync and CPU-backed NV12 upload paths using that session.

Debian 13 ships libva 2.22. A driver built against libva 1.20 remains loadable
because libva searches compatible lower minor-version init symbols.

## Intended capability order

| Codec | Decode | Encode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 Baseline/Main/High | Baseline and High validated; Main pending | High validated through 1080x2340 |
| HEVC Main 8-bit | validated on QCM6490, 720p and 1080p, bit-exact | validated on QCM6490, CBR |
| VP8 | planned | planned |
| VP9 Profile 0 | validated on QCM6490, bit-exact | not exposed by the firmware |

The initial H.264 path passed a 30-frame byte-exact VA-API hardware test on
Raphael. See [device validation](docs/device-validation.md). Other codec
profiles remain hidden until their own submission paths pass the same test.

## Build

Debian 13 dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build pkg-config libva-dev libdrm-dev libudev-dev vainfo
```

Configure, build and test:

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

Probe the live Venus nodes:

```bash
./build/venus-vaapi-info
```

On a Raphael test device, validate the internal V4L2 session independently
from VA-API:

```bash
sudo ./tests/run-v4l2-h264.sh
```

The script generates a progressive 640x480 H.264 stream with access-unit
delimiters, decodes 30 frames through `venus-v4l2-decode`, compares the raw
NV12 output with software decoding, and saves the complete userspace and
kernel evidence under `/var/tmp`.

Validate the experimental VA-API path:

```bash
sudo ./tests/run-vaapi-h264.sh
```

This runs `vainfo`, decodes the same 30-frame stream through FFmpeg VA-API and
`hwdownload`, compares every NV12 byte, and enables userspace backend tracing
for the test only.

Validate the isolated H.264 encoder session:

```bash
sudo ./tests/run-v4l2-h264-encode.sh
```

The encoder test generates 30 NV12 frames, encodes them through the project's
own V4L2 session, drains the device and requires software decoding to recover
all 30 frames.

Validate the H.264 VA-API encoder path:

```bash
sudo ./tests/run-vaapi-h264-encode.sh
```

This uploads 30 NV12 frames into VA surfaces, encodes them through
`VAEntrypointEncSlice`, maps each `VACodedBufferSegment`, and requires
software decoding to recover all 30 frames.

Run the full resolution, round-trip and repeated-session matrix:

```bash
sudo ./tests/run-vaapi-h264-matrix.sh
```

The matrix covers 640x480, 720p, 1080p, the Raphael display's
1080x2340 and 2340x1080 orientations, and a 300-frame 720p session. It
compares software and VAAPI decoded frame hashes and verifies visible
dimensions and kernel logs.

Test driver loading after the first codec profile is implemented:

```bash
LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH="$PWD/build" LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=venus \
vainfo --display drm --device /dev/dri/renderD128
```

Validate the complete H.264 matrix and install system-wide:

```bash
./scripts/validate-and-install.sh
```

See [usage](docs/usage.md) for FFmpeg encode/decode commands and runtime
environment setup.

## Design

Venus exposes a stateful V4L2 decoder and encoder. The VA backend translates
libva object lifetimes and picture submissions to the two V4L2 M2M queues. It
does not access HFI directly and does not copy the Android OMX implementation
into userspace.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the interface boundary,
capability policy and implementation stages.

## Completed first milestone

The H.264 VLD milestone completed:

1. load the backend through libva;
2. create CPU-visible NV12 surfaces;
3. assemble a valid stateful H.264 access unit from VA buffers;
4. decode 30 frames through qcom-venus;
5. download all frames and compare them with software decode;
6. close and reopen the session without leaking buffers or wedging firmware.
